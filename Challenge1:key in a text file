Challenge:Find the key/password hidden in a text file key.txt

Solution:
 grep -o "[[:alnum:]]" key.txt | tr -d '\n'
 
 Explanation:
 In this command, grep -o "[[:alnum:]]" is used to match and display only the alphabetic characters and digits from key.txt, with each character on a separate line.
 The tr -d '\n' part of the command is used to remove the newline characters (\n) from the output, effectively concatenating all the characters into a single line.
 
 Output:
PKey2030115bd38485e8b352f60f2b90f8a932ad0e95
